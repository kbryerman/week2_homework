# week2_homework
Creation of Website Layout
<p>Began laying out portfolio website and look/feel of what I want moving forward. I definitely struggled with understanding how floats and positiion:relative interact with each other. I also had difficulty removing .DS_Store from the repo after attempting to follow the github instructions. I still want to add links to social media and more text over the next week.</p>
<p>Also struggling to attach screenshots, but they are attached to my repo</p>
